# Web3j-Android Library

## Introduction

The **web3j-android** library provides an Android-compatible implementation of the **web3j** library, enabling developers to interact with the Ethereum blockchain directly from Android applications. It simplifies blockchain integration for mobile developers by offering a tailored solution that addresses Android-specific constraints and environments.

## Why a Separate Android Version?

Creating a dedicated version for Android was necessary to address compatibility issues between the original Java library and Android-specific environments. This ensures seamless performance and integration within mobile apps.

## Minimum Requirements

- **Java Version**: JDK Version 17 or higher
- **Android SDK Version**: 24 or higher
- **Dependency**: `org.web3j:web3j-android:4.6.0`
